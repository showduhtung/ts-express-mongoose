## ðŸ˜Ž Introduction

The TypeScript Express Mongoose Starter is a comprehensive boilerplate for building robust and scalable web applications using the TypeScript programming language, Express.js framework, and Mongoose ORM for MongoDB. It provides a solid foundation and a set of best practices to kickstart your TypeScript-based Express projects with ease.

## Features

- **TypeScript:** Enjoy the benefits of static typing, enhanced code maintainability, and better developer tooling with TypeScript.
- **Express.js:** Build powerful and flexible web APIs using the popular Express.js framework.
- **Mongoose:** Utilize the elegant MongoDB object modeling library Mongoose for seamless integration with MongoDB databases.
- **Error Handling:** Implement centralized error handling and consistent error responses across your application.
- **Environment Configuration:** Manage your application's configuration using environment variables with the help of the dotenv library.
- **Linting and Formatting:** Maintain clean and consistent code with ESLint and Prettier pre-configured.
- **Testing with Jest:** Write unit tests and run them using the Jest testing framework.
- **Docker Integration:** Easily containerize your application using Docker for simplified deployment and scalability.
- **SWC Compiler:** Utilize the SWC compiler for faster TypeScript compilation and improved performance.

## Configuration

Before starting the project, make sure to set up your database credentials in the `.env.development.local` file. This file is used for local development and should not be committed to version control. Here's an example of how the `.env.development.local` file should be structured:

### Database Configuration

- **DB_HOST=** 127.0.0.1
- **DB_PORT=** 27017
- **DB_DATABASE=** dev
- **LOG_FORMAT=** dev
